load priceY.dat   % alternatively, load('q1y.dat')
load featuresX.dat

v = featuresX(1:10); % first 10 elements of q1x (counts down the columns)
t = priceY(1:10);

% fopen, fread, fprintf, fscanf also work  [[not needed in class]]
A = [1 2; 3 4; 6 7]
%% indexing
A(3,2)  % indexing is (row,col)
A(2,:)  % get the 2nd row. 
        % ":" means every element along that dimension
A(:,2)  % get the 2nd col
A([1 3],:) % print all  the elements of rows 1 and 3

A(:,2) = [10; 11; 12]     % change second column
A = [A, [100; 101; 102]]; % append column vec
A(:) % Select all elements as a column vector.

% Putting data together 
A = [1 4; 3 4; 5 6]
B = [11 12; 13 14; 15 16] % same dims as A
C = [A B]  % concatenating A and B matrices side by side
C = [A, B] % concatenating A and B matrices side by side
C = [A; B] % Concatenating A and B top and bottom
